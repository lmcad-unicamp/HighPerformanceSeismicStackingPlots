# HighPerformanceSeismicStackingPlots

This repo holds python files responsible for plotting the results of 
[HighPerformanceSeismicStacking](https://github.com/lmcad-unicamp/HighPerformanceSeismicStacking) 
through matplotlib.


## Execution

To generate all graphs, run `python3 main.py`. This project comes also with helper functions to
search for the data in a folder. That was important in order to put all results together in 
[HighPerformanceSeismicStackingClapExperiments](https://github.com/lmcad-unicamp/HighPerformanceSeismicStackingClapExperiments) 
repository. Inside each of the files containing experiment results, there are links pointing to a folder
inside this repository.
